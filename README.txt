Greetings,

Welcome to my github and to my example apps folder. This is a quick demonstration of some fundamental Android App development 
to show some basic Java functionality as well as more Androidy themes like generating intents, handling APIs, parsing JSON etc.

The apps were mostly compiled on Android Studio 2.0 and have had their gradle updated to 2.1. They were written for a minimum API of
21.

I'll be updating my lists fairly regularly as I continue to grow my skill set.

Regards,
Keone Martin
